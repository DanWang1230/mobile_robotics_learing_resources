# mobile_robotics_learing_resources

This repo contains a comprehensive report about the field of mobile robotics. This report consists of three main parts.

## Literature review

This part surveys books, articles, blog posts, and tutorials about mobile robotics. You can refer to this literature review in `References.md` to find the specific learning materials available online, dive into the subfileds (such as motion planning), and figure out the techinical details.

## Slides-based demonstration

This part summarizes the status quo of the main subfields in mobile robotics. In this part, you will find definition of terminology and answers to questions like what the problem at hand is, why the problem is important, which algorithms to use to solve the problem, and what the features of different algorithms are.

## Interactive hands-on projects

This part inlcudes some hands-on projects related to mobile robotics. Those projects would faciliate learning algorithms and knowledge interactively and honing your programming skills. The used programming languages are mostly python and C++. Most of the projects are developed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Notes
- Throughout this report, the field of mobile robotics is divided into three main subfields: **State estimation and localiztion**, **Perception**, and **Motion planning**.
- Besides the resources in Part I, this report also refers to materials from CSE571 AI Based Mobile Robotics (UW), CSE478 Autonomous Robotics (UW), Self-driving Car Specialization (Coursera), Self-driving Car Specialization (Udacity), and Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree (Udacity).
- This repo is being actively updated.
